    <p>
        Hello My name is Rubival Santos, but my friends call me Rubinho Lima. This is how I am also known in my work.
        I own a production logistics producer for TV shows, called Atrium Solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
        I graduated at the age of 22 in Computer Science and for a few months I worked in the IT area of ​​a company called
        Emilio Odebrecht Foundation. From where I was chosen to work on a local television called TV Bahia,
        in the IT support area, where I worked only a few months, since I had lunch every day near the journalism
        production department, I gradually used my computer skills to improve the broadcasting of news stories
        that were broadcast at night throughout the state.
    </p>

    <p>
        My work was soon recognized and I was transferred to the largest television network in Brazil,
        from where I originally am, working with soap operas, entertainment and sports programs, such as
        soccer and formula 1.
    </p>

    <p>
        We moved with my family in 2000 to the United States and I am still working with production logistics.
    </p>

    <p>
        With age and lived experience, I decided it was time to change once again and return to my origins.
        So today I went back to school and I am very pleased to be part of a reputable university, doing what I
        like and pleased to have all the support of teachers, TA's, staff and career support to reach my goals ...
        I can only be grateful and be proud of it!
    </p>
